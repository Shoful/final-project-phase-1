# Recipe Desk üçΩÔ∏è

Recipe desk is a responsive website that allows the user to find popular recipes or search recipes. Whichever they choose, they will be lead to a more detailed page with a summary of the recipe, ingredients, and instructions on how to prepare the meal. Below the details, they will find a button to find similar recipes. Here this will lead to them to a list of similar recipes to the one that they were just on.
